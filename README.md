# Summary

Conclusion:
  * The more popular stations may require the most reparation and maintenance
  * There needs to be a more seemless transaction for customers that are not subscribers to the ride share service to accurately report data
 
Suggestion to add for better customer experience and can be utilized for future analysis and visualization:
  * A proposal to provide customers and subscribers alike to self-report damaged stations or bikes may prove beneficial to both the company and customer base
   * Map of the location of the bikes that are frequently reported in needing maintenance and or reparation
  * Provide the users a time window that provides information of traffic based on peak rush hours
